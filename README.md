IoT Based Safety Gadget for Child Safety Monitoring &amp; Notification

Problem Statement:To help the parents in continuously monitor their 
                                         children so that they can simply leave their 
                                         children in school or parks and create a geofence 
                                         around their location.




Idea description: We are  continuously monitoring the 
                 child’s location and updating the 
                 information to the parent or the 
                 caretakers using notifications.
                 Also, we are  overseeing the health related information of the child.
                 We are  providing the provision for 
                 the child to intimate an emergency 
                 situation.
                 If necessary, the parent and the child 
                 can communicate by sending voice 
                 messages.
                 Parents can request child’s location 
                 when required instead of monitoring all 
                 the time. 
                 Every one hour the location of the child 
                 will be updated to the parent.
